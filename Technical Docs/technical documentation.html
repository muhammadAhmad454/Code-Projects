                <p>Pitman shorthand is a system of shorthand for the English language developed by Englishman Sir Isaac
                    Pitman (1813 - 1897), who first presented it in 1837. Like most systems of shorthand, it is a phonetic
                    system; the symbols do not represent letters, but rather sounds, and words are, for the most part,
                    written as they are spoken.

                    Shorthand was referred to as phonography in the 19th century. It was first used by newspapers who
                    sent phonographers to cover important speeches, usually stating (as a claim of accuracy) that they
                    had done so. The practice got national attention in the United States in 1858 during the
                    Lincoln–Douglas Debates which were recorded phonographically. The shorthand was converted into words
                    during the trip back to Chicago, where typesetters and telegraphers awaited them. Pitman shorthand
                    was the most popular shorthand system used in the United Kingdom and the second most popular in the
                    United States.

                    One characteristic feature of Pitman shorthand is that unvoiced and voiced pairs of sounds
                    <code> (such as /p/ and /b/ or /t/ and /d/) </code> are represented by strokes which differ only in
                    thickness; the thin stroke representing "light" sounds such as /p/ and /t/; the thick stroke
                    representing "heavy" sounds such as /b/ and /d/. Doing this requires a writing instrument responsive
                    to the user's drawing pressure: specialist fountain pens (with fine, flexible nibs) were originally
                    used, but pencils are now more commonly used.

                <p>Every language has vowels, but languages vary in the number of vowel sounds they use. While we learn
                    <code>A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y,</code> English, depending on speaker and dialect, is generally
                    considered to have at least 14 vowel sounds.</p>

                <p>The consonants in Pitman's shorthand are pronounced bee, pee, dee, tee, jay, chay, gay, kay, vee,
                    eff, thee, ith, zee, ess, zhee, ish, em, el, en, ray ar, ing, way, yay, and hay. When both an
                    unvoiced consonant and its corresponding voiced consonant are present in this system, the
                    distinction is made by drawing the stroke for the voiced consonant thicker than the one for the
                    unvoiced consonant. <code>(Thus s is ⟨)⟩ and z is ⟨)⟩.)</code> There are two strokes for r: ar and
                    ray. The former assumes the form of the top right-hand quarter of a circle (drawn top-down), whereas
                    the latter is like chay ⟨/⟩, only less steep (drawn bottom to top). There are rules governing when
                    to use each of these forms</p>

            <article>
                <p>The long vowels in Pitman's shorthand are:
                    <code>/ɑː/, /eɪ/, /iː/, /ɔː/, /oʊ/, and /uː/. The short vowels are /æ/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /ɒ/, /ʌ/, and /ʊ/. The long vowels may be remembered by the sentence, "Pa, may we all go too?" /pɑː | meɪ wiː ɔːl ɡoʊ tuː/, and the short vowels may be remembered by the sentence, "That pen is not much good" /ðæt pɛn ɪz nɒt mʌt͡ʃ ɡʊd/.</code>
                    A vowel is represented by a dot or a dash, which is written with either a light stroke (for a short
                    vowel) or heavy stroke (for a long vowel). For example, sate is written as ")•|", but set is written
                    as ")·|"; seat is written as ").|", but sit is written as ").|". Vowels are further distinguished by
                    their position relative to the consonant stroke – beginning, middle or end – for a total of 12
                    possible combinations.

                    Another feature of Pitman's shorthand allows most vowels to be omitted in order to speed up the
                    process of writing. As mentioned above, each vowel is written next to either the beginning, middle
                    or end of the consonant stroke. Pitman's shorthand is designed to be written on lined paper and when
                    a word's first vowel is a "first position" vowel (i.e. it is written at the beginning of the
                    stroke), the whole shorthand outline for the word is written above the paper's ruled line. For a
                    second position vowel, the outline is written on the line, and for a third position vowel, it is
                    written through the line. In this way, the position of the outline indicates that the first vowel
                    can only be one of four possibilities. In most cases, this means that the first and often all the
                    other vowels can be omitted entirely.</p>

                <p>There are twelve vowels in Shorthand which are represented by dots and dashes. These twelve vowels
                    are equally divided into three places i.e. four in first place, four in second place and four in
                    third place. 2 Vowels are represented by dots and dashes written along side the consonant strokes.

            <article>
                <p>There are four diphthongs in Pitman's shorthand, representing /aɪ/, /ɔɪ/, /aʊ/, /juː/, as in the
                    words "I enjoy Gow's music." The first three appear as small checkmarks; the "ew" sound is written
                    as a small arch. Both "ie" and "oi" are written in first position, while "ow" and "ew" are written
                    in third position. In the same way, the whole outline is placed above, on or through the paper's
                    ruled line. If the diphthong is followed by a neutral vowel, a little flick is added.</p>

                        Circles are of two sizes – small and large. A small circle represents 's' (sing) and 'z' (gaze).
                        A large circle at the beginning of a word represents the double consonant 'sw' (sweep).
                        Elsewhere it represents 's-s': a sequence of two 's' or 'z' sounds with a vowel in between
                        (crisis, crises or exercise). The vowel in the middle may be any of the vowels or diphthongs,
                        though any vowel other than 'e' must be notated inside the circle.

                        Loops are of two sizes – small and large. The small loop represents 'st' and 'sd' (cost and
                        based). The large loop represents 'ster' (master or masterpiece). The 'ster' loop is not used at
                        the beginning of a word; i.e, it would not be used to notate the word sterling.

                        <strong> Stroke-initial hooks</strong>. For straight strokes, an initial hook may be written in
                        a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A clockwise initial hook represents 'r' after the
                        stroke (tray, Nichrome, bigger). A counter-clockwise initial hook represents 'l' after the
                        stroke (ply, amplify, angle). For curved strokes, the hook is written inside the curve and a
                        small hook represents 'r' while a large hook represents 'l'.

                    <dd>
                        <strong> Stroke-final hooks</strong>. For straight strokes, a final hook may be written in a
                        clockwise or counterclockwise direction. A clockwise final hook represents 'en' after the stroke
                        (train, chin, genuine), while a counter-clockwise final hook represents 'eff' or 'vee' after the
                        stroke (pave, calf, toughen). For curved strokes, the hook is written inside the curve and it
                        represents 'n' after the stroke (men, thin).
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        <strong> 'Shun' hook</strong>. A large hook written at the end of a stroke represents the sound
                        'shun' or 'zhun', as in fusion or vision. The 'shun' hook is written either to the left or right
                        depending on the positions of other attachments and vowels in the stroke.

                    <dd>If a word contains 'ter', 'der', 'ture', 'ther', or 'dher' — for example, in matter, nature, or
                        mother — the preceding stroke is written double the size. There are exceptions to avoid
                        ambiguous forms; for example, "leader" is not written as a doubled-l but as l plus a hooked-d
                        representing "dr". In contrast, "later", for example, is written with a doubled-l. Straight
                        strokes at the beginning of a word are not doubled unless they have a final hook or attached
